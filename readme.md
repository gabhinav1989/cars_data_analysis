## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project contains information on used cars, encompassing 17 features such as mileage, year, brand, and more. This data is employed to train machine learning models for predicting car prices.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and gain insights into the dataset. This step was crucial for making informed decisions during the modeling process.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and other necessary steps to prepare the dataset for predictive modeling.

## Predictive Modeling

Various regression techniques, including Random Forest Regression, were applied to predict car prices. The models were optimized using techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and GridSearchCV. Performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared were used to evaluate model performance.

## Visualization

Visualization plays a key role in conveying insights. The project includes visualizations such as line graphs showing actual vs. predicted values, histograms for car sales by price groups, and more.

## Deployment

An overview or steps on how to perform deployment is also provided at the end.

## Report

A report to the client is also included that contains information on how data set is used along with some recommendations on how to use the model to adjust the inventory etc.
